        <p style="color: aliceblue; padding: 50px;">Advertising hoardings are the large boards erected around a construction site, which can prominently feature printed graphics and designs. While these panels can be (and sadly often are) left blank, theyâ€™re hugely effective as the basis for an
            outdoor advertising campaign.These can take almost any form, but usually feature a few standard features such as branding, logos, and the name/address/phone number details of the business placing the advert. The unique format of hoardings
            also makes them a good opportunity for a unique creative design, which makes use of the long, large format with striking imagery or graphic design.</p>
