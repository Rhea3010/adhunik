        <p style="color: aliceblue; padding: 50px;">Digital signage brings new life to any commercial environment. The impact of static signs is becoming less significant, but digital signage, on the other hand, is designed to catch the attention of consumers and deliver messages that are custom
            designed to improve their experience. A digital signage display can show graphics, video, and other content on anything from small form factor screens to giant video walls. What about interactive digital signage? This interactive technology
            takes things to another level, allowing customers to interact with content that can include product research, locating inventory, viewing more product options, and even opportunities to virtually "try-on" products.
