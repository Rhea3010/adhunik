                            But be careful in the amount of information you add on a business card. </p>

        <p style="color: aliceblue; padding: 50px;">A business card is the most basic yet essential marketing tool every business must-have. It provides a convenient, relatively low-priced method to promote your business to everyone you meet, everywhere you go. However, most of the time the business
            card is left under-appreciated and very little thought or time is devoted to designing this crucial communication tool. Smart design strategists turn the business cards into an impressive marketing tool. The planning speaks favourably for
            business, every design element like colour, typeface, space, image, and logo, etc. has its planned use within the card for the specified impact.</p>
